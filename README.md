# Heart_failure_model
Classification Model

# Data Set
The dataset has 12 attributes that contains the vairous reasons that can result for heart failure such has BP, diabetes, platelets and more... and has the target coulumn death event that has the information if the person died during the followup period or not it is a binary field

# Objective
As we knpw that heart failure is one of the leading reasons for death.
Our obective here is to analyze the dataset and make a model to predict the outcome for a paitent given all the data.
